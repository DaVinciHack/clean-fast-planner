# Flight Legs Implementation Status

## Completed

1. **Data Models**
   - Created proper data models in `FlightModel.js` for:
     - `Flight`: Main container for legs and metadata
     - `Leg`: Represents a flight leg between two stops
     - `Stop`: Represents a main point (departure, destination)
     - `Waypoint`: Represents an intermediate navigation point

2. **Route Management**
   - Created `RouteManager.js` to replace the existing `WaypointManager`
   - Implemented methods for adding/removing stops and waypoints
   - Added edit mode switching between 'stops' and 'waypoints'
   - Added support for leg-based route structure
   - Implemented route dragging to add waypoints

3. **UI Components**
   - Created `WaypointModeToggle.jsx` for switching between stops and waypoints mode
   - Created `LegsPanel.jsx` for displaying and managing legs and waypoints
   - Added styles in `RouteStyles.css` for new components
   - Updated `MapInteractionHandler.js` to work with the new RouteManager

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Main Application**
   - Update `FastPlannerApp.jsx` to use the new RouteManager instead of WaypointManager
   - Replace references to waypoints with the new leg-based structure
   - Update existing UI components to work with the new data models

2. **Route Calculation Updates**
   - Update `RouteCalculator.js` to work with legs and waypoints
   - Ensure fuel and time calculations work with the new structure

3. **OSDK Integration**
   - Update code that saves flights to Palantir to support the leg structure
   - Ensure waypoints are preserved when loading flights from Palantir

4. **Testing**
   - Test adding/removing stops and waypoints
   - Test route dragging functionality
   - Test loading and saving flights to Palantir

## Additional Features for Future Implementation

1. **Alternate Route Support**
   - Add support for alternate routes in the data model
   - Create UI for adding and editing alternate routes

2. **Improved Waypoint Handling**
   - Add better support for dragging intermediate waypoints
   - Implement reordering of waypoints within a leg

3. **Route Templates**
   - Create functionality to save and load route templates
   - Add UI for selecting and applying templates

## Notes

- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the existing API
- The OSDK integration preserves the `combinedWaypoints` and `displayWaypoints` fields for compatibility
- The implementation clearly distinguishes between stops and waypoints for easier editing
