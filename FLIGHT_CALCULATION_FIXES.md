# Flight Calculation Fixes

## Applied Fixes

The following fixes have been applied to resolve the fuel calculation issues:

1. **Enhanced FlightCalculations Module**: 
   The `FlightCalculations.js` module has been updated to provide:
   - Improved consistency in calculations
   - Better logging for debugging
   - Detailed breakdowns of fuel components

2. **Improved FlightSettings Component**:
   The `FlightSettings.jsx` component has been updated with:
   - An "Update Calculations" button to force recalculation
   - Improved change handling for settings
   - Better logging of settings changes

3. **Fixed Syntax Errors**:
   - Addressed syntax errors in the ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx file

## How to Test the Fixes

1. Start the application
2. Create a route with multiple waypoints
3. Go to the Settings tab and change values like:
   - Deck Time (e.g., from 5 to 10 minutes)
   - Reserve Fuel (e.g., from 600 to 800 lbs)
   - Contingency Fuel (e.g., from 10% to 15%)
4. Click the "Update Calculations" button in the Settings tab
5. Return to the main tab to verify the values in the top card have updated

## Debugging

If issues persist:

1. Open the browser's developer console
2. Look for logs with "FlightSettings:" and "Flight calculations:"
3. Check if settings changes are being properly logged
4. Verify if the calculation results are updated

## Further Improvements

For a more comprehensive fix, consider:

1. Creating a central state management system for flight settings
2. Adding more detailed validation for input values
3. Implementing a more robust calculation trigger system
