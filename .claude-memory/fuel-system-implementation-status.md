# Fuel System Implementation Status & Memory Update

## âœ… **Completed Backend Work (Palantir)**

### **Enhanced Fuel Calculations:**
- **FlightFuelService.ts**: Enhanced `calculateDeckFuel` method with priority logic
- **AlternateFuelService.ts**: Both locations updated with enhanced deck fuel logic
- **New Aircraft Field**: `flatPitchFuelBurnDeckFuel` (Double) - 900 lbs/hr for deck operations
- **New Policy Field**: `deckFuelTime` (Double) - 15 minutes deck time per stop
- **Priority Logic**: flatpitch Ã— time â†’ flatpitch Ã— default â†’ legacy policy amount

### **Weather-Based Fuel Logic:**
- **ARA Fuel**: Added when weather ranking2 = 8 or 5 (for rigs)
- **Approach Fuel**: Added when weather ranking2 = 10 or 5 (for airports)
- **Distribution Logic**: 
  - ARA fuel appears before rigs, consumed at rigs
  - Approach fuel carried throughout entire remaining route
  - Multiple airports = multiple approach fuel amounts from start

### **Calculation Results:**
- **Working**: 15 min Ã— 900 lbs/hr = 225 lbs deck fuel (vs old 200 lbs)
- **Debug Confirmed**: AlternateFuelService working correctly
- **Published**: Functions published in Palantir
- **OSDK**: New fields added, OSDK being regenerated

## ðŸš§ **Current Fast Planner Status**

### **Existing Fuel Components:**
- **FuelCalculationManager.js**: Basic fuel calculations
- **WeatherFuelAnalyzer.js**: Weather-based fuel analysis (NEW)
- **WeatherStopCardFuelDistributor.js**: Proper stop card distribution (NEW)
- **EnhancedFuelManager.js**: Integrates weather with fuel system (NEW)
- **ManualFuelOverride.js**: Manual mode for weather failures (NEW)

### **Integration Points:**
- **Stop Card Calculator**: Enhanced version created but not integrated
- **Settings Page**: Currently uses browser storage, needs policy integration
- **Fuel Tab**: Using evacuation tab temporarily
- **OSDK**: Old version, needs update with new fields

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Technical Decisions Made**

### **Fuel Policy Priority:**
1. **Policy Defaults**: Loaded from Palantir fuel policies
2. **User Overrides**: Stored locally, preserved when possible
3. **Manual Mode**: Complete override when weather APIs fail
4. **Aircraft-Specific**: flatpitch burn rates per aircraft type

### **Weather Integration:**
- **Same Logic as Palantir**: ranking2 values determine fuel requirements
- **Live Updates**: Fuel recalculates when routes change
- **Stop Card Distribution**: Proper consumption logic implemented
- **Comparison Capability**: Compare with imported Palantir fuel

### **UI Architecture:**
- **Fuel Tab**: Replace evacuation tab with dedicated fuel management
- **Settings Integration**: Show policy defaults vs user overrides
- **Manual Override**: Complete interface for weather failures
- **Policy Display**: Show which policy is active and why

## ðŸ”§ **Architecture Patterns Established**

### **Manager Pattern:**
- **EnhancedFuelManager**: Extends FuelCalculationManager with weather awareness
- **WeatherFuelAnalyzer**: Standalone weather analysis
- **ManualFuelOverride**: Standalone override management

### **Distribution Pattern:**
- **WeatherStopCardFuelDistributor**: Handles proper fuel consumption logic
- **EnhancedStopCardCalculator**: Integrates weather with existing stop cards

### **Policy Integration Pattern:**
- **FuelPolicyLoader**: Loads policies from Palantir OSDK
- **Settings Enhancement**: Auto-populate from policies
- **Override Management**: Track policy vs user values
