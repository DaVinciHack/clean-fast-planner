# Session Summary - 2025-05-22

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Platform/Map Layer Improvements
- Fixed `isbase` field detection (was checking `isBase` instead of lowercase)
- Improved platform colors:
  - Fixed platforms: Dark blue center with bright blue ring
  - Blocks: Brighter purple for visibility
  - Bases: Hot pink for distinction
- Fixed label zoom levels - now start appearing at zoom 7.5-8
- Labels use text-opacity for smooth fade-in

### 2. Finance Calculator Enhancements
- **Added Day Rate field** - checkbox + dollar amount input
- **Added Fuel Cost Calculator**:
  - Unit selector (gallons/liters/lbs)
  - GPH/LPH/PPH input
  - Fuel price per unit
  - Calculation: Time × Consumption × Price
- **Fixed hourly rate precision** - now accepts exact values like $3,148
- **Changed label** to "Total Estimated Cost"
- **Improved UI/UX**:
  - Organized into clear sections
  - Better styling with CSS
  - Smaller fonts except total (larger, italic)
  - Blue border around cost breakdown

### 3. Attempted Features (Need Revisiting)
- Pill visibility based on line segment length - proved complex, needs different approach

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `PlatformManager.js` - Color updates, isbase fix, label zoom levels
2. `FinanceCard.jsx` - New fields, calculations, improved layout
3. `FinanceCard.css` - New styling for better UI
4. `WaypointManager.js` - Attempted pill visibility (partially working)

### Key Learnings:
- OSDK field names are case-sensitive
- Mapbox GL prefers `text-opacity` over `min-zoom` for gradual appearance
- Complex JSX restructuring requires careful handling of ternary operators

## Next Steps:
1. **PDF Generation** for finance calculator
2. **WaypointManager refactoring** (2000+ lines)
3. **iPad UI optimization**
4. **Revisit pill visibility** with fresh approach

## Important Notes:
- No dummy data or mock values
- Aviation safety standards maintained
- All calculations use real data from OSDK
- Finance calculator stores preferences in localStorage
