# Session Log - 2025-01-22

## Session Start
- Time: Initial session with Duncan
- Context: First time working together on FastPlannerV5
- Claude Model: Opus 4 with ~200k token context

## Project Understanding
- FastPlannerV5 is an aviation flight planning application
- Built with React, TypeScript, Vite
- Connects to Palantir Foundry via OSDK
- Critical aviation software - no dummy data or shortcuts allowed

## Current State per Duncan
- Many documents in the codebase are outdated
- Calculations have been centralized into one place
- Main issue: Code has grown too big and messy, needs refactoring
- Previous issues with passenger counts, deck time, etc. appear to be resolved

## Initial Setup
- Created `.claude-memory` directory structure for cross-session memory
- Ready to begin focused refactoring work

## Next Steps
- Need Duncan to clarify:
  1. Which module contains the centralized calculations?
  2. What specific part needs refactoring first?
  3. Any immediate pain points or performance issues?


## Fix Applied - Bases and Label Zoom Levels

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Bases not showing** - Added lowercase checks for 'y' and 'yes' in isBase field
2. **Label zoom levels** - Added minzoom settings:
   - Platform labels (fixed and movable): minzoom 12
   - Block labels: minzoom 13
   - Bases labels: already had minzoom 11

### Technical Details:
- Created backup: PlatformManager.js.backup-2025-05-22T19-00-35-090Z
- Modified isBase checks to include: 'Y', 'y', 'Yes', 'yes', 'YES'
- Also checks is_base field with same variations
- Labels now only appear when zoomed in past specified levels

### Result:
- Bases with lowercase 'y' values should now appear on the map
- Platform and block labels won't clutter the map at high zoom levels
- Labels appear progressively as you zoom in

### Testing Needed:
- Verify bases now show correctly when toggled on
- Check that platform/block labels only appear when zoomed in
- Ensure performance is good with thousands of markers


## Fixed Issues - Correct Solution

### Problem 1: Bases Not Showing
- **Root Cause**: Field name was `isbase` (all lowercase), not `isBase`
- **Fixed**: Changed all checks to use `item.isbase`
- **Result**: Bases with values 'Y', 'y', 'Yes', 'yes', 'YES' should now appear

### Problem 2: Labels Disappeared  
- **Root Cause**: `min-zoom` property wasn't working as expected in Mapbox GL
- **Fixed**: Used `text-opacity` with zoom interpolation instead
- **Result**: 
  - Platform labels (fixed & movable): Hidden below zoom 12, visible at 12+
  - Block labels: Hidden below zoom 13, visible at 13+
  - Labels fade in smoothly as you zoom

### Technical Details
The opacity approach works better because:
- It's a paint property (always supported)
- Provides smooth fade-in effect
- More compatible with Mapbox GL versions
- Easier to debug in browser

### Testing
Bases should now show when:
1. Toggle "Bases" is ON
2. Platform has `isbase` field with value: Y, y, Yes, yes, or YES

Labels should now only appear when zoomed in past:
- Zoom 12 for platforms
- Zoom 13 for blocks


## Final Success - All Issues Resolved

### Bases Now Working
- Fixed field name from `isBase` to `isbase` (all lowercase)
- Bases with values Y/y/Yes/yes/YES now show correctly

### Labels Now Working with Better Zoom Levels
- Fixed formatting issues with visibility property
- Adjusted zoom levels for better usability:
  - **Platforms**: Fade in at zoom 9, fully visible at 10+
  - **Blocks**: Fade in at zoom 10, fully visible at 11+
  - **Bases**: Visible at zoom 11+
  - **Airfields**: Always visible
- Text sizes adjusted for each zoom level

### Key Learnings
1. Field names from OSDK are case-sensitive (`isbase` not `isBase`)
2. Mapbox GL text-opacity works better than min-zoom for gradual appearance
3. Fade-in effects (opacity 0.3) help reduce clutter at transition zooms
4. Gulf of Mexico has thousands of platforms - needed careful zoom management

### Result
Users can now see platform labels much sooner (zoom 9-10) instead of having to zoom all the way to 12-13, making navigation much more practical while still avoiding clutter.
