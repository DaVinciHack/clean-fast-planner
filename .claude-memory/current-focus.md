# Current Focus: Alternate Route Completion & Stop Card Implementation

## Overview
We are finalizing the alternate route functionality in the FastPlanner application:

1. ✅ **Clear Route Enhancement** - COMPLETED
2. ✅ **Alternate Split Point Logic** - COMPLETED 
3. **Alternate Stop Card Implementation** - Add an alternate stop card at the end of the stop cards list

## Core Principles (CRITICAL)
- No quick fixes or workarounds - only proper structural improvements
- No dummy or mock data that could be mistaken for real values
- Clean, maintainable code that accurately represents real-world aviation data
- Take one step at a time with thorough testing
- Remember this is aviation software - no shortcuts or potentially misleading numbers

## ✅ COMPLETED: Clear Route Enhancement
- Enhanced `clearRoute` functionality to clear both main route and alternate route data
- Fixed syntax issues and added comprehensive alternate route clearing

## ✅ COMPLETED: Split Point Logic

### What Was Implemented
1. **New Flight Logic**: When alternate added with single destination → split point = first landing point
2. **Loaded Flight Logic**: Use existing split point from flight data (already working)
3. **Two-Location Logic**: Split point = first location (already working correctly)

### Implementation Details
- **`determineNewFlightSplitPoint` function**: Intelligently finds first landing point from current waypoints
- **Enhanced single-location logic**: Distinguishes between new flights vs loaded flights
- **Comprehensive logging**: Added detailed console logs for debugging split point determination

### Testing Required
- Test new flight: Add route, then add single-location alternate → verify split point = first stop
- Test loaded flight: Load flight with alternate → verify uses original split point
- Test two-location alternate → verify split point = from location

## Next Actions

### Phase 3: Alternate Stop Card (NEXT) 
**Requirement**:
- Orange circle with "A" icon, display alternate name, small font "alternate leg" text  
- Fuel, time, and passenger calculations for alternate route
- Appears ONLY when alternate route exists, positioned at END of stop cards list

## Next Immediate Action
**READY FOR**: Testing the split point logic and then implementing alternate stop card.
