# Current Focus: COMPREHENSIVE Fuel System Integration

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
**PROBLEM**: Race conditions in fuel system causing crashes + Missing integration for wind/weather/alternates
**SOLUTION**: Create comprehensive MasterFuelManager for ALL fuel calculations

## 🌪️ **CRITICAL ADDITIONS IDENTIFIED**
1. **Wind Calculations** - Must integrate `WindCalculations.js` system
2. **Weather Segments** - Must integrate weather segment fuel analysis (ARA/approach)  
3. **Alternate Routes** - Must integrate alternate route fuel calculations
4. **Weather-to-Fuel Flow** - Weather segments → ARA/approach fuel requirements

## 📋 **UPDATED NEXT ACTION**
**Phase 1**: Create COMPREHENSIVE MasterFuelManager.js (3-4 hours) ⬆️ INCREASED SCOPE
- `/modules/fuel/MasterFuelManager.js` - Core unified manager WITH wind/weather integration
- `/hooks/useMasterFuelManager.js` - React hook wrapper  
- `/modules/fuel/WindIntegrator.js` - Wind calculations coordinator (NEW)
- Test comprehensive integration before moving to next phase

## 🚨 **CRITICAL RULES (UPDATED)**
1. **No race conditions** - Sequential updates only
2. **Single source of truth** - MasterFuelManager owns ALL fuel data (including wind/weather/alternate)
3. **No quick fixes** - Proper structural improvements only
4. **Test each phase** - Before moving to next phase  
5. **Aviation safety** - No dummy data, real calculations only
6. **Wind consistency** - Same wind data used for all calculations ⬅️ NEW
7. **Weather integration** - Weather segments flow through fuel system ⬅️ NEW
8. **Alternate accuracy** - Same fuel policies for main and alternate routes ⬅️ NEW

## 📊 **UPDATED STATUS**
- **Analysis**: ✅ Complete mapping INCLUDING wind/weather/alternate systems  
- **Plan**: ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan updated
- **Memory**: ✅ Updated with complete integration requirements
- **Scope**: ⬆️ EXPANDED to cover all fuel-related calculations
- **Ready**: ✅ Ready to start comprehensive Phase 1 implementation

## 🔧 **UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**
1. **Create COMPREHENSIVE MasterFuelManager** (3-4h) → NEXT ⬆️ EXPANDED
2. **Weather & Wind System Integration** (2-3h) ⬅️ NEW PHASE
3. **Alternate Route Integration** (2-3h) ⬅️ NEW PHASE  
4. **Stop Cards Integration** (1-2h)
5. **Settings & UI Integration** (1-2h)
6. **Complete Integration Testing** (2-3h) ⬆️ EXPANDED

**Total**: 12-15 hours estimated ⬆️ INCREASED for comprehensive solution
