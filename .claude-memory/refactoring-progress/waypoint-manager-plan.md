# Session Progress - 2025-01-22

## Understanding Gained

### Project Evolution
- Started as financial quoting tool
- Now comprehensive flight planning system used by:
  - Financial team (original purpose - quick quotes)
  - Pilots (flight planning)
  - Clients (passenger capacity planning)
- Integrates with Palantir Foundry
- Dramatically reduces planning time: 30 mins â†’ <1 minute

### Current State
1. **WaypointManager.js** - 2049 lines (needs refactoring)
   - Core methods: addWaypoint, updateRoute, setupRouteDragging
   - Mixed responsibilities: UI, data, map interactions
   - Contains inline classes and heavy map manipulation

2. **Map Layers System** - Already implemented
   - MapLayersCard component exists
   - Toggle functionality for:
     - Platforms/Airfields
     - Fixed/Movable platforms
     - Blocks/Bases
     - Fuel availability
     - Weather/VFR charts
     - Gulf Coast overlays

3. **Recent Work**
   - Waypoint manager improvements
   - Route line enhancements
   - Some issues remain

## Proposed Action Plan

### Phase 1: WaypointManager Refactoring
1. **Extract WaypointRouteRenderer.js** (~400 lines)
   - Move updateRoute() method
   - Handle route drawing/arrows
   - Manage route layers

2. **Extract WaypointMarkerManager.js** (~300 lines)
   - createWaypointMarker()
   - updateMarkerPopup()
   - Marker lifecycle management

3. **Extract WaypointDragHandler.js** (~400 lines)
   - setupRouteDragging()
   - All drag event handlers
   - Route drag visualization

4. **Extract WaypointSnapUtil.js** (~200 lines)
   - Platform/waypoint snapping logic
   - Coordinate validation
   - Name resolution

5. **Core WaypointManager.js** (~500 lines)
   - Keep data management
   - Coordinate with other modules
   - API methods

### Phase 2: Complete Map Layer Features
- Finish show/hide for all platform types
- Ensure consistent behavior across regions
- Test with real OSDK data

### Phase 3: Calculation Updates
- Review centralized calculations
- Add fuel component to finance calculator
- Ensure accuracy for all flight parameters

### Phase 4: PDF Generation
- Design PDF layout for financial team
- Include all relevant flight data
- Real-time generation capability

### Phase 5: iPad UI Support
- Responsive design updates
- Touch-optimized controls
- Testing on actual devices
