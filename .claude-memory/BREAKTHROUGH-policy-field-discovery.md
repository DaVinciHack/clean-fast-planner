# üéâ CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: Aircraft Policy Field Discovery

## üö® **MAJOR ISSUE RESOLVED (June 1, 2025)**

**THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED!** The aircraft wasn't finding its fuel policy because we had the wrong understanding of OSDK field structure.

### üîç **ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED:**

**OSDK Field Structure is Confusing:**
- ‚ùå **WRONG ASSUMPTION**: `defaultFuelPolicyId` contains a policy ID
- ‚úÖ **ACTUAL REALITY**: `defaultFuelPolicyId` contains the **POLICY NAME**
- ‚ùå **WRONG ASSUMPTION**: `defaultFuelPolicyName` contains the policy name  
- ‚úÖ **ACTUAL REALITY**: `defaultFuelPolicyName` is often `undefined`

### üìä **EXAMPLE OF THE CONFUSION:**
```
Aircraft OSDK Data:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ defaultFuelPolicyName: "undefined" ‚ùå
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ defaultFuelPolicyId: "GOM Tester S92 Line flight to be removed" ‚úÖ (This is actually the NAME!)
```

### ‚úÖ **THE WORKING SOLUTION:**
```javascript
// CORRECT: defaultFuelPolicyId actually contains the policy NAME
const actualPolicyName = aircraft?.defaultFuelPolicyName || aircraft?.defaultFuelPolicyId;

// Search policies by NAME, not ID
const policy = policies.find(p => p.name === actualPolicyName);
```

### üéØ **CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED:**

1. **OSDK field names are misleading** - `defaultFuelPolicyId` ‚â† actual ID
2. **This was working before** - got broken during refactoring
3. **Always verify OSDK field contents** - don't assume field names match contents
4. **Aircraft specifies its own policy** - no searching/guessing needed

### üöÄ **CURRENT STATUS:**
- ‚úÖ **Aircraft selects correct Gulf of Mexico policy** (not Norway fallback)
- ‚úÖ **Fuel flow data preserved**: `flatPitchFuelBurnDeckFuel: 600`
- ‚úÖ **No more fallbacks**: Clean OSDK data flow
- ‚úÖ **System working as designed**: Aircraft ‚Üí Policy ‚Üí Calculations

### üîß **KEY FILES FIXED:**
- `FuelPolicyService.js` - Policy search logic corrected
- `AircraftManager.js` - All OSDK fields properly extracted
- `StopCardCalculator.js` - Uses real aircraft fuel flow data

## üö® **CRITICAL FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è OSDK FIELD NAME WARNING:**
```
NEVER ASSUME OSDK FIELD NAMES MATCH THEIR CONTENTS!

defaultFuelPolicyId = Policy NAME (not ID)
defaultFuelPolicyName = Often undefined
flatPitchFuelBurnDeckFuel = Actual fuel flow rate
assetIdentifier = Clean aircraft registration
registration = Display name (corrupted with region)
```

### **‚úÖ CORRECT ARCHITECTURE ACHIEVED:**
```
1. Region Selection ‚Üí Load regional policies
2. Aircraft Selection ‚Üí Aircraft specifies its policy by NAME
3. Policy Lookup ‚Üí Direct name match (no searching)
4. Fuel Calculation ‚Üí Real OSDK data (no fallbacks)
5. Display ‚Üí Accurate calculations
```

### **üéØ AVIATION SAFETY PRINCIPLES MAINTAINED:**
- ‚ùå **No fallbacks** - Real OSDK data or error
- ‚ùå **No dummy data** - All calculations from aircraft specs  
- ‚ùå **No guessing** - Aircraft tells us which policy to use
- ‚úÖ **Single source of truth** - OSDK is authoritative

*BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED: June 1, 2025*
*Status: System working correctly with real OSDK data*
*Key Discovery: OSDK field names can be misleading - always verify contents*
