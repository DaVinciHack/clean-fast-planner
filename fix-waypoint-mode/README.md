# Fixing Waypoint Mode Duplication Issue

## Problem Description

The Fast Planner application has an issue with waypoint insertion. When clicking on the map in waypoint mode, both the regular stop handler and waypoint handler are being triggered simultaneously, causing duplicate points to be added.

### Root Cause

1. There are multiple handlers competing for map click events:
   - `MapInteractionHandler.js` - The main handler for map clicks (adds stops)
   - `WaypointHandler.js` - A dedicated handler for waypoint mode (adds waypoints)
   - `ModeHandler.jsx` with `separate-mode-handler.js` - Another approach handling waypoint mode

2. When waypoint mode is activated:
   - The `window.isWaypointModeActive` flag is set correctly
   - But the original map click handlers in `MapInteractionHandler` are still active
   - This causes both handlers to be triggered, resulting in duplicate points

## Solution

The fix modifies two key files:

### 1. MapInteractionHandler.js
- Added code to the `handleMapClick` method to check if waypoint mode is active
- If waypoint mode is active, the handler now ignores map clicks entirely
- This prevents the original handler from adding regular stops when in waypoint mode

### 2. WaypointHandler.js
- Modified the `setEnabled` method to properly update the global `window.isWaypointModeActive` flag
- Enhanced the `handleWaypointClick` method to stop event propagation to prevent other handlers from firing
- Added code to force a route redraw after adding a waypoint

## Implementation

Run the `apply-waypoint-fix.sh` script in this directory to apply the fixes.

```
cd /Users/duncanburbury/FastPlannerMaster/FastPlannerV5/fix-waypoint-mode
./apply-waypoint-fix.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create backups of the original files
2. Apply the fixes using sed
3. Provide confirmation when complete

## Verification

After applying the fix:
1. Restart the application
2. Click the "Add Waypoints" button to enter waypoint mode
3. Click on the map - you should see only waypoints (yellow markers) being added, not regular stops
4. Exit waypoint mode and verify that normal functionality is restored

## Rollback

If needed, you can restore the original files from the backups:

```
cd /Users/duncanburbury/FastPlannerMaster/FastPlannerV5/src/components/fast-planner/modules/
mv MapInteractionHandler.js.before-waypoint-fix MapInteractionHandler.js
mv WaypointHandler.js.before-waypoint-fix WaypointHandler.js
```
