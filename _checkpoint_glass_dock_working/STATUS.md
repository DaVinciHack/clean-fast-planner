# Glass Dock Development Status

## âœ… CHECKPOINT SAVED SUCCESSFULLY! 

**Location:** `/Users/duncanburbury/FastPlannerMaster/FastPlannerV5/_checkpoint_glass_dock_working/`

### ðŸ“‚ Saved Files:
- `FastPlannerApp.jsx` - Main app with always-visible dock
- `GlassMenuDock.jsx` - Complete expandable dock component
- `GlassMenuDock.css` - Responsive styling for all screen sizes
- `CHECKPOINT_README.md` - Documentation of current state
- `restore_checkpoint.sh` - Executable restore script

### ðŸš€ What's Working:
âœ… **Always-visible glass dock** (no longer requires flight load)  
âœ… **Expandable horizontal design** with smooth animations  
âœ… **Clean button styling** - round for Lock/Close, shorter rectangular for others  
âœ… **Icons above text** layout matching your reference image  
âœ… **Responsive design** that works perfectly on iPad, mobile, and desktop  
âœ… **Staggered button animations** on expansion  
âœ… **Beautiful glassmorphism effects** with proper blur and transparency  

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Development Phase:
- Connect expanded buttons to their corresponding cards
- Integrate with existing right panel card system
- Handle panel animation/switching logic  
- Fine-tune colors and active states

### ðŸ”„ How to Restore (if needed):
Run from the FastPlanner directory:
```bash
./_checkpoint_glass_dock_working/restore_checkpoint.sh
```

Or manually copy the files back from the checkpoint directory.

**This checkpoint represents a stable, working foundation before complex card integration begins.**
