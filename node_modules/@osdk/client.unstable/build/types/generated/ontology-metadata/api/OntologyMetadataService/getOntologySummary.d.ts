* Endpoint to load a summary of an Ontology including the number of entities of each type visible to the user.

* migrated to roles are also considered visible regardless of the users permissions on the backing datasources
* (i.e. the endpoint runs using `includeObjectTypesWithoutSearchableDatasources` set to true).
*
* The results in this endpoint are eventually consistent with the latest OntologyVersion and may lag slightly
* behind the last Ontology modification.
