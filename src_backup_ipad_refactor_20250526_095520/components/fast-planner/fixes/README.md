# Fast Planner Waypoint Functionality Fixes

This directory contains targeted fixes for waypoint functionality in the Fast Planner application.
These fixes address specific issues with waypoint handling without changing any styles.

## The Issues Fixed

1. **Waypoint Creation Problem**: When in waypoint mode, the application was still adding stops instead of waypoints.

2. **Route Drag Issue**: Dragging the route line added stops regardless of whether the application was in waypoint mode or not.

3. **Inconsistent Waypoint Mode Flags**: The global waypoint mode flag was not being properly recognized by all components.

## The Fix Files

### 1. `fix-waypoint-functionality.js`
- Ensures that when in waypoint mode, points are added as waypoints (not stops)
- Fixes the `addWaypoint` and `addWaypointAtIndex` methods to properly check the global waypoint mode flag
- No style changes - only fixes the core functionality

### 2. `fix-route-drag.js`
- Specifically fixes the route dragging functionality to respect waypoint mode
- Ensures that dragging the route line adds waypoints when in waypoint mode
- Includes a test function `window.testRouteDragFix()` to verify the fix

### 3. `WaypointDebugger.js`
- Provides utility functions to debug and verify waypoint functionality
- No functional changes - only debugging tools
- Available via window.logWaypoints(), window.verifyWaypointMode(), etc.

## How to Apply the Fixes

Run the following script to apply all fixes at once:

```bash
./apply-all-waypoint-fixes.sh
```

Or run individual fix scripts:

```bash
./apply-waypoint-functionality-fix.sh
```

## Testing the Fixes

After applying the fixes and reloading the Fast Planner application:

1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Use the following debug commands:
   - `window.logWaypoints()` - List all waypoints with their types
   - `window.verifyWaypointMode()` - Check if waypoint mode is working
   - `window.toggleWaypointMode()` - Toggle waypoint mode programmatically
   - `window.testRouteDragFix()` - Test if route dragging is fixed

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- When in waypoint mode, clicking on the map adds a waypoint (type: 'WAYPOINT')
- When in normal mode, clicking on the map adds a stop (type: 'STOP')
- When dragging the route line in waypoint mode, a waypoint is added (not a stop)
- When dragging the route line in normal mode, a stop is added

## Verification

After applying the fixes, you should see:

1. All points added in waypoint mode have `isWaypoint: true` and `type: 'WAYPOINT'`
2. All points added in normal mode have `isWaypoint: false` and `type: 'STOP'`
3. The waypoint vs. stop classification is maintained throughout the application
