# Isolated Map Interactions Fix

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing critical issues with map interactions:

1. **Multiple Waypoint Creation**: A single click would add multiple waypoints
2. **Platform Clicking Issues**: Clicking on rigs/platforms didn't work correctly
3. **Route Drag Problems**: Dragging route line added points at the end instead of inserting
4. **UI Interference**: Left panel and other UI interactions conflicted with map clicks

## Isolated Map Interactions Solution

This aggressive fix completely isolates all map interactions into a single controller that takes precedence over all other event handlers. It uses an event interception approach to ensure all map interactions go through a single, controlled channel.

### Key Features

1. **Complete Event Isolation**:
   - Removes ALL existing map click handlers
   - Intercepts and filters click events throughout the application
   - Ensures only one handler processes each click

2. **Single Source of Truth**:
   - Creates a central controller for all map interactions
   - Maintains a clear state of the interaction mode
   - Provides consistent behavior across all map elements

3. **Click Protection**:
   - Implements debouncing to prevent rapid/duplicate clicks
   - Tracks click state to avoid processing overlapping clicks
   - Maintains a queue to process clicks in order if needed

4. **Route Drag Improvements**:
   - Properly tracks drag state to prevent click events during drag
   - Ensures waypoints are inserted at the correct position in the route
   - Provides proper platform snap functionality during drag operations

5. **Global UI Integration**:
   - Adds a waypoint mode toggle button for easy mode switching
   - Shows clear notifications for user actions
   - Provides visual feedback for current mode and operations

## Implementation Details

The fix uses several advanced techniques to ensure reliable operation:

### Event Interception
The solution overrides the native `addEventListener` method to intercept click events and filter them based on the target element. This ensures only appropriate elements can receive click events, preventing competing handlers.

### State Management
The controller maintains internal state to track:
- Current waypoint/stop mode
- Ongoing drag operations
- Click processing status
- Last click coordinates and timestamps

### Map Event Handling
The solution provides clean implementations of key map interaction methods:
- `handleMapClick`: For clicks on the map background
- `handlePlatformClick`: For clicks on platforms, rigs, and airports
- `handleRouteClick`: For clicks on the route line
- `addWaypoint`: Central method to add waypoints from any source

## How to Use

The fix is automatically applied when importing `isolated-map-interactions.js`. It will:

1. Initialize a global controller available as `window.isolatedMapInteractionController`
2. Add a waypoint mode toggle button in the top-right corner of the map
3. Show notifications for successful interactions and mode changes

## Verification

After applying the fix, verify that:

1. Clicking on the map adds only a single waypoint
2. Clicking on rigs/platforms correctly adds them to the route
3. Dragging the route line inserts waypoints at the correct position
4. Left panel and other UI elements work without triggering map clicks

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Try refreshing the page to ensure the fix is fully loaded
3. Use the Waypoint/Stop Debug button for diagnostics
4. Use the waypoint mode toggle button to manually switch modes
5. Ensure no other scripts are attempting to add their own event handlers

## Technical Notes

- This is an aggressive fix designed to override all other click handling
- It maintains compatibility with the waypoint vs. stop distinction functionality
- The fix handles all map-related click events while allowing UI interactions to pass through
- It's designed to work alongside other fixes but takes complete precedence for map interactions
