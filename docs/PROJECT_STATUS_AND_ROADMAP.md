# Fast Planner V3 Project Status and Roadmap

## Current Status (May 6, 2025)

### Completed Work

#### 1. Core Application Refactoring
- Successfully migrated from monolithic to modular architecture
- Implemented proper component structure with separation of concerns
- Created manager-based modules for different functionalities:
  - MapManager for map display and interactions
  - WaypointManager for route waypoints and coordinates
  - AircraftManager for aircraft data and selection
  - RouteCalculator for route statistics calculations
  - RegionManager for geographical region management

#### 2. Wind Input System
- Fixed synchronization between two input locations (MainCard and WeatherCard)
- Implemented proper wind direction normalization (0-359 range)
- Enhanced updateWeatherSettings function with better state management
- Added comprehensive documentation for wind system
- Created verification script for wind input functionality

#### 3. Project Cleanup
- Removed duplicate implementations and unused files
- Fixed hardcoded references to localhost:8080
- Implemented dynamic redirect URL generation for deployment flexibility
- Consolidated into a single implementation (FastPlannerApp)
- Documented cleanup process with verification scripts
- Established proper git tagging for version control

#### 4. UI Improvements
- Implemented proper responsive panels
- Fixed styling and layout issues
- Enhanced route display with improved time indicators

### Current Working Features

- **Authentication**: OAuth connection to Palantir Foundry
- **Region Selection**: Working selection between different operational regions
- **Aircraft Selection**: Filtering and selection of aircraft by type and registration
- **Route Creation**: Adding waypoints by clicking on map or selecting from favorites
- **Wind Input**: Properly working wind direction and speed inputs that stay in sync
- **Basic Route Calculations**: Distance, time, and fuel consumption calculations

## Roadmap for Future Development

### Phase 1: Enhanced Calculations (Current Priority)

#### Fuel Calculations
- [ ] Improve fuel burn calculations with better accuracy
- [ ] Implement contingency fuel calculations
- [ ] Add support for different fuel types and units
- [ ] Integrate with aircraft performance data
- [ ] Create fuel estimation visualization

#### Passenger (Pax) Calculations
- [ ] Implement passenger weight calculations
- [ ] Create passenger capacity estimation based on fuel load
- [ ] Add support for different aircraft configurations
- [ ] Implement cargo weight calculations
- [ ] Develop passenger distribution optimization

### Phase 2: Foundry Integration

#### Route Export to Flight Planner
- [ ] Implement route export functionality to Palantir Flight Planner
- [ ] Create route serialization format
- [ ] Build OSDK integration for route upload
- [ ] Add validation before export
- [ ] Implement status tracking for exported routes

#### Weather Integration
- [ ] Connect to weather data sources via OSDK
- [ ] Implement weather data visualization on map
- [ ] Create weather-based route optimization
- [ ] Add weather alerts and warnings
- [ ] Implement weather forecast integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
- [ ] Implement data caching strategies
- [ ] Reduce application bundle size
- [ ] Improve API request handling
- [ ] Add offline capabilities

#### Enhanced UI/UX
- [ ] Create more intuitive waypoint interaction
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop route editing
- [ ] Add route comparison tool
- [ ] Develop customizable dashboard
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly responsive design

#### Data Analytics
- [ ] Add historical route analysis
- [ ] Implement fuel usage reporting
- [ ] Create flight efficiency metrics
- [ ] Develop cost estimation tools
- [ ] Add export capabilities for reports

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use React contexts for state management
- Implement proper error handling
- Document all public functions and interfaces
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all calculation functions
- Implement integration tests for module interactions
- Add end-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Create manual testing procedures for new features
- Verify compatibility across browsers

### Version Control
- Use feature branches for new development
- Create tags for significant milestones
- Write detailed commit messages
- Perform code reviews before merging
- Maintain changelog for user-facing changes

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- Limited error handling for API failures
- Performance issues with large numbers of waypoints
- Incomplete mobile responsiveness
- Limited offline capabilities
- Some calculation edge cases not handled

### Technical Debt
- Need better TypeScript type coverage
- Some components still too large and need further decomposition
- Test coverage is incomplete
- Documentation needs expansion for new developers
- Build process could be further optimized

## Conclusion

The Fast Planner V3 project has made significant progress in refactoring and cleanup. The application is now more maintainable, has a cleaner structure, and key functionality like the wind input system is working correctly. The immediate focus is on enhancing the fuel and passenger calculations, followed by deeper integration with Palantir Foundry services for the Flight Planner and weather data.

This roadmap provides a clear direction for future development while acknowledging the current limitations and technical debt that should be addressed over time.
