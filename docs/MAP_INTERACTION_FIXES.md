# Fast Planner Map Interaction Fixes

This document outlines the critical fixes made to the map interaction system to resolve several longstanding issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double-click Issue (Fixed)
**Problem:** Clicking on the map would sometimes add two waypoints instead of one.

**Root Cause:** The MapInteractionHandler was both triggering callbacks AND directly adding waypoints, resulting in duplication.

**Solution:**
- Modified MapInteractionHandler to ONLY trigger callbacks and never add waypoints directly
- Added processing flags to prevent duplicate event handling
- Implemented proper try/finally blocks to ensure flags are always cleared

### 2. Waypoint Names Issue (Fixed)
**Problem:** Clicking on airports/rigs was adding waypoints with generic names (e.g., "Stop 1") instead of the actual location names.

**Root Cause:** The snapping logic wasn't being properly applied in the addWaypoint implementation.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the addWaypoint implementation to properly check for nearby platforms
- Increased snapping distance from 2nm to 5nm for better usability
- Added support for multiple name property formats (name, platformName, displayName)
- Fixed the property extraction to ensure names are correctly assigned

### 3. Drag Placement Issue (Fixed)
**Problem:** Dragging the route line was adding waypoints to the end of the list rather than at the correct insertion point.

**Root Cause:** The route drag handler wasn't properly passing the nearest platform to the callback.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the handleRouteDragComplete method to find and include nearby platforms
- Added explicit validation of the insertion index
- Added more comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Improved error handling to prevent unexpected failures

### 4. Panel Interaction Issue (Fixed)
**Problem:** The left panel wasn't receiving click events properly.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect z-index hierarchy and pointer-events CSS settings.

**Solution:**
- Created panel-interaction-fix.css with proper z-index values
- Set explicit pointer-events: auto for all interactive elements
- Created proper isolation contexts for better event handling

## Key Changes

### MapInteractionHandler.js
- Complete redesign of the handleMapClick method
- Added window._processingMapClick flag to prevent duplicate processing
- Enhanced error handling with try/catch/finally blocks
- Improved logging for better debugging

### FastPlannerApp.jsx
- Fixed the addWaypointDirect implementation to correctly handle platform snapping
- Increased snapping distance from 2nm to 5nm
- Added support for multiple waypoint name properties
- Added enhanced error logging

### WaypointManager.js
- Modified setupRouteDragging to properly handle drag completion
- Added platform snapping to the drag handler
- Fixed how insertion index is validated and used

### panel-interaction-fix.css
- Created targeted CSS to solve specific interaction issues
- Established proper z-index hierarchy (panel > stats > map)
- Fixed pointer-events for all clickable elements

## Testing These Fixes

When testing this version, you should observe:

1. Clicking on the map adds exactly ONE waypoint
2. Clicking on/near airports and rigs correctly adds them with their proper names
3. Dragging the route line inserts waypoints at the exact spot where you drag
4. Left panel buttons and controls work properly without clicks falling through to the map

All these changes were implemented by fixing the underlying issues rather than adding more patches or workarounds.
