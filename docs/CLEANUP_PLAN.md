# Fast Planner V3 Cleanup Plan

## Completed Phase 1: Initial Cleanup

### 1. Fixed Hardcoded URLs
- Updated client.ts to use dynamic redirect URL generation
- Removed hardcoded reference to localhost:8080

### 2. Simplified Implementation
- Simplified FastPlannerPage.jsx to only use FastPlannerApp component
- Removed conditional rendering and multi-implementation logic
- Moved old/duplicate implementation files to src/_old_components/

### 3. Verified Initial Changes
- Created verification script to check key changes
- Ensured application still starts correctly after changes

## Phase 2: Component Cleanup (Next Steps)

### 1. Remove Duplicate Component Files
- Identify and move any additional duplicate components
- Check for old versions of components in src/components/fast-planner/components
- Remove any old/unused context implementations

### 2. Clean Up Imports
- Update import statements in all files to remove references to old components
- Check for and fix any broken imports after moving files

### 3. Streamline Directory Structure
- Reorganize files for consistency:
  - Place all components in appropriate subdirectories
  - Ensure clear separation between UI and logic components

## Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Improve Error Handling
- Add better error handling to API calls
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

### 2. Fix Hard-coded Values
- Check for and remove any remaining hard-coded values
- Use environment variables or dynamic values where appropriate

### 3. Enhance Responsiveness
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Add responsive design elements for different screen sizes

## Phase 4: Build and Deployment Optimizations

### 1. Build Process
- Optimize build process
- Reduce bundle size

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- Setup configuration for different environments
- Add environment-specific settings

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize data fetching patterns

## Testing After Each Phase

After each phase of cleanup, perform the following tests:

1. **Authentication Test**
   - Verify the OAuth flow works with the dynamic redirect URL
   - Check that users can log in and access the application

2. **Core Functionality Test**
   - Create a route with multiple waypoints
   - Select an aircraft
   - Verify wind inputs work in both MainCard and WeatherCard

3. **Integration Test**
   - Check that route calculations update correctly
   - Verify stop cards display proper information
   - Test aircraft selection and filtering

## How to Use This Plan

1. Complete each phase in order
2. Run the verification script after each set of changes:
   ```
   ./scripts/verify_cleanup.sh
   ```
3. Test the application thoroughly after each phase
4. Commit working changes to version control

## Version Control Strategy

1. Create a branch for each phase:
   ```
   git checkout -b phase2-component-cleanup
   ```
2. Make small, incremental commits
3. Test thoroughly before merging
4. Keep the main branch stable
