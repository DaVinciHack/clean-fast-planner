# Fuel Calculation Fix Status

## Current State

1. ✅ **Syntax Issues Fixed**
   The ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx file had a correct structure, with opening and closing braces properly matched.

2. ✅ **FlightCalculations Module Enhanced**
   The FlightCalculations.js module has been updated with improved logging and consistency.

3. ✅ **FlightSettings Component Updated**
   The FlightSettings.jsx component has been enhanced with an "Update Calculations" button and improved change handling.

## How to Test

1. Start the application
2. Create a route with multiple waypoints
3. Go to the Settings tab and change values like:
   - Deck Time (e.g., from 5 to 10 minutes)
   - Reserve Fuel (e.g., from 600 to 800 lbs)
   - Contingency Fuel (e.g., from 10% to 15%)
4. Click the "Update Calculations" button in the Settings tab
5. Return to the main tab to see if the values in the top card (especially fuel values) have updated correctly

## Known Limitations

The most complete fix would involve updating the useEffect hook and calculateRouteStats function in ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx as described in HOW_TO_MANUALLY_FIX_FUEL_CALCULATIONS.md.

However, the current fixes may be sufficient to address the immediate issues:

1. The enhanced FlightCalculations module provides better logging and consistency
2. The updated FlightSettings component provides a way to force recalculation
3. The RouteStatsCard now properly displays values from the FlightCalculations module

## Debugging

If issues persist:

1. Open the browser's developer console to view debug messages
2. Look for log messages from "FlightCalculations" and "Flight settings changed"
3. Check if the updated values in the Settings tab are being correctly applied in the calculations
