We've fixed the fuel calculation issues in the Fast Planner application by:

## 1. Updated FlightSettings.jsx
- Added improved change handling
- Added a debug "Update Calculations" button
- Enhanced logging to track settings changes

## 2. Updated RouteStatsCard.jsx
- Now properly uses values from FlightCalculations
- Fixed display of deck fuel, total fuel, and passenger calculations
- Eliminated redundant local calculations

## 3. Updated ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx
- Enhanced calculateRouteStats function:
  - Always updates FlightCalculations config before calculations
  - Provides more detailed logging
  - Ensures settings are consistently applied

- Improved FlightCalculations useEffect hook:
  - Properly updates FlightCalculations on settings changes
  - Triggers route recalculation when settings change
  - Logs changes for easier debugging
  
## Testing the Fixes
1. Create a route with multiple waypoints
2. Go to Settings tab and change values:
   - Deck Time
   - Reserve Fuel
   - Deck Fuel Flow
3. Click "Update Calculations" button
4. Return to main tab and verify top card values are updated
5. Check browser console for detailed logs

## Future Improvements

- Implement more direct binding between settings and calculations
- Add comprehensive error handling and validation
