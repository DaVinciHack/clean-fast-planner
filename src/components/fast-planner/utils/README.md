# Clean Map Layer Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a clean, reliable approach for map layer management, replacing all the individual "fix" scripts that were causing conflicts and errors.

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Layer Management**
   - Checks if layers/sources exist before adding
   - Properly handles layer visibility
   - Consistently removes layers before sources

2. **Simplified Code Structure**
   - One centralized management utility
   - No more duplicate fix scripts
   - Clear, documented API

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Proactively prevents "layer already exists" errors
   - Gracefully handles failure scenarios
   - Safe, timeout-based approach for async operations

4. **Consistent Naming**
   - Clear layer and source naming conventions
   - Prevents ID conflicts
   - Tracking of active layers and sources

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main files:

1. `CleanMapManager.js` - Core utility providing safe layer/source management
2. `CleanPlatformManager.js` - Clean implementation of platform and waypoint management
3. `CleanMapIntegration.js` - Main entry point that initializes and connects everything

## Specific Fixes

This implementation fixes the following issues:

- "Layer with id 'osdk-waypoints-labels' already exists" errors
- "Source 'major-platforms' cannot be removed while layer is using it" errors
- Waypoint mode toggle issues
- Platform layer visibility inconsistencies
- Map initialization timing problems

## Usage

No code changes are needed in other components. The clean implementation patches the main manager methods with proper layer management automatically.

- `MapLayerManager.addLayer()` - Safely adds layers with duplicate checks
- `MapLayerManager.addSource()` - Safely adds sources with duplicate checks
- `MapLayerManager.removeLayer()` - Safely removes layers
- `MapLayerManager.removeSource()` - Safely removes sources after layers

## Future Maintenance

When making changes to map functionality:

1. Always use the MapLayerManager utility for layer operations
2. Maintain layer/source naming conventions to avoid conflicts
3. Avoid adding more "fix" scripts - update the clean implementation instead
