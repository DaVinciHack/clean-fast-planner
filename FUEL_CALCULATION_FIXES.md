# Fast Planner Fuel Calculation Fixes

This document describes the changes needed to fix the fuel calculation issues in the Fast Planner application.

## Files Fixed

1. `RouteStatsCard.jsx` - Updated to use the values from FlightCalculations directly, ensuring consistency between the display and the actual calculations.

## Additional Changes Required

For complete functionality, please implement the following changes in the ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx file:

### 1. Enhanced Handler Functions

Replace the existing handler functions with the enhanced versions in `/tmp/Handler_Functions_Fix.js`. These updated functions ensure that when a setting is changed:

- The FlightCalculations module is updated with the new setting value
- The route statistics are recalculated with the new settings
- The route is updated with the new calculation results

### 2. Enhanced FlightCalculations useEffect

Replace the useEffect for FlightCalculations initialization with the enhanced version in `/tmp/FlightCalculations_Effect_Fix.js`. This ensures that:

- FlightCalculations is properly initialized with all settings
- Changes to settings trigger updates to FlightCalculations
- Route recalculation is triggered when settings change

### 3. Enhanced calculateRouteStats Function

Replace the existing calculateRouteStats function with the enhanced version in `/tmp/calculateRouteStats_Fix.js`. This ensures that:

- FlightCalculations is used consistently for all route calculations
- All parameters are properly passed to FlightCalculations
- Results are properly captured and displayed

## Implementation Steps

1. âœ… The RouteStatsCard.jsx file has already been updated
2. Open ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx and implement the remaining changes
3. Test the application to ensure fuel calculations are updated correctly when settings change

## Changes Summary

These changes ensure that:

1. The top card shows the correct deck fuel, total fuel, and passenger information
2. When you update values in the settings panel, all calculations are updated consistently 
3. The FlightCalculations module is used as the single source of truth for all fuel-related calculations

The key issue was that when settings were changed, the FlightCalculations module wasn't always updated, and the route statistics weren't always recalculated with the new settings.

## Testing

After implementing these changes, you should test the application by:

1. Creating a route with multiple waypoints
2. Changing various settings (reserve fuel, taxi fuel, contingency percentage, etc.)
3. Verifying that the top card values update correctly with the new settings
4. Verifying that passenger calculations are consistent with the fuel and aircraft specifications
