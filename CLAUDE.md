This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üö® CRITICAL SESSION START PROTOCOL üö®

**ALWAYS DECLARE WHEN YOU ARE STARTING FROM A CONVERSATION SUMMARY**

If you are Claude starting from a conversation summary (not a fresh conversation), you MUST:

1. **IMMEDIATELY TELL THE USER** - Start your first message with: "‚ö†Ô∏è I'm starting from a conversation summary and don't have full context. Let me understand where we are..."
2. **ASK FOR CURRENT STATUS** - Ask what the user wants to do next, don't assume
3. **READ THE SUMMARY CAREFULLY** - Don't jump ahead based on incomplete information
4. **WAIT FOR DIRECTION** - Let the user guide you to the current task

**NEVER assume you know what to do next when starting from a summary. The user gets frustrated when you jump in without understanding the current state.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDER - READ FIRST ‚ö†Ô∏è

**DO NOT RUSH AHEAD OR MAKE ASSUMPTIONS**

Before making ANY changes to this codebase:

1. **UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT STATE FIRST** - Read and analyze existing code thoroughly
2. **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION** - Don't assume you understand complex systems like fuel calculations or weather integration
3. **EXPLAIN YOUR UNDERSTANDING** - Clearly state what you think the current workflow is before making changes
4. **GET CONFIRMATION** - Wait for user confirmation that your understanding is correct
5. **MAKE TARGETED CHANGES ONLY** - Don't rewrite entire systems or make broad changes

**REMEMBER: This codebase has complex fuel systems, weather integration, and calculation workflows that took weeks to implement. One rushed change can destroy significant work that cannot be recovered.**

## üõ°Ô∏è CORE PRINCIPLES - AVIATION SOFTWARE

**This is aviation software - lives depend on accurate data. NO SHORTCUTS.**

### Mandatory Development Standards:

1. **No quick fixes or workarounds** - Only proper structural improvements to the code
2. **No runtime injections** that create technical debt
3. **No dummy or mock data** that could be mistaken for real flight values
4. **No fallbacks** that could be interpreted as actual flight data
5. **Clean, maintainable code** that accurately represents real-world aviation data
6. **One step at a time** with thorough testing at each stage
7. **No potentially misleading numbers** - all calculations must be precise and verified
8. **Use MCP tools** for development and analysis

### Safety-First Approach:
- Every fuel calculation must be accurate
- Every flight time must account for real conditions
- Every weather integration must use verified data
- Test extensively before any changes go live

### üîß AREAS FOR FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
- **Fuel System Optimization**: Further refinement of segment-aware calculations
- **Weather-Fuel Integration**: Enhanced real-time weather impact on fuel requirements
- **User Experience**: Additional UI polish and workflow improvements

## üõ©Ô∏è FUEL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Single Source of Truth: `StopCardCalculator.js`
The fuel system is centralized in `/src/components/fast-planner/modules/calculations/flight/StopCardCalculator.js` which serves as the single source of truth for ALL fuel calculations.

**Key Components:**
- **Weather Integration**: `WeatherFuelAnalyzer.js` analyzes weather segments for ARA and approach fuel
- **Segment Logic**: `SegmentUtils.js` handles refuel-aware fuel distribution
- **UI Integration**: `EnhancedStopCardsContainer.jsx` displays fuel calculations

### Fuel Calculation Workflow:
```
Input Sources ‚Üí Weather Analysis ‚Üí StopCardCalculator ‚Üí UI Display
```

**Aviation Fuel Types:**
- **ARA Fuel**: Required for rig approaches in poor weather (consumed at destination)
- **Approach Fuel**: Required for airport approaches in poor weather (carried throughout)
- **Extra Fuel**: Discretionary fuel added at fuel stops

### Current Status: 
‚úÖ **Working**: Core fuel calculations, weather analysis, segment detection  
üîß **Optimization Opportunities**: Enhanced real-time integration, UI refinements

## ‚õΩ CRITICAL AVIATION FUEL LOGIC - READ BEFORE ANY FUEL CHANGES

**IMPORTANT: This section documents the precise aviation fuel logic that must be understood before making ANY fuel-related changes.**

### üöÅ ARA Fuel (Airborne Radar Approach Fuel)  
**Purpose**: Required for approaching rigs with bad weather conditions

**User Input Logic**:
- User inputs ARA fuel AT the rig that needs it (where it will be consumed)
- Input represents the amount that rig will CONSUME on approach

**Calculation & Display Logic**:
- ARA fuel is CARRIED from last refuel point (or departure if no refuel)
- Shows in ALL stop summaries BEFORE the rig that needs it
- Shows 0 in the summary AT the rig (already consumed on approach)
- Display shows `card.fuelComponentsObject?.araFuel` (calculated remaining), NOT user input

**Example**: User inputs 200 ARA for Rig3. Departure summary shows ARA:200, Stop1 shows ARA:200, Stop2 shows ARA:200, Rig3 shows ARA:0

### üõ¨ Approach Fuel (Airport Approach Fuel)
**Purpose**: Required for approaching airports with bad weather conditions

**Logic**: Identical to ARA fuel but for airports instead of rigs
- User inputs AT the airport that needs it
- Carried from last refuel/departure  
- Shows in summaries BEFORE the airport
- Shows 0 AT the airport (consumed on approach)
- Display shows calculated remaining amount, not user input

### ‚úàÔ∏è Extra Fuel (Discretionary Fuel)
**Purpose**: Additional fuel carried "just in case" - pilot discretion

**User Input Logic**:
- Can ONLY be added at locations WHERE fuel is being added (departure or refuel stops)
- Input fields are disabled/blanked at other locations
- Represents additional fuel beyond calculated requirements

**Calculation & Display Logic**:
- Shows in ALL summaries from input point forward
- Continues until next refuel stop OR destination
- Display shows user input first: `getFuelValue(stopName, 'extraFuel') || calculated`
- Does NOT get consumed at intermediate stops (unlike ARA/approach)

**Example**: User adds 100 extra fuel at departure. All stops show Extra:100 until reaching a refuel stop.

### üîÑ Summary Display Logic
**What each stop summary represents**: "Minimum fuel needed to depart from this location and complete the flight"

**Critical Rule**: 
- ARA/Approach fuel shows REMAINING amount (calculated)
- Extra fuel shows INPUT amount (user override then calculated)
- Fuel consumed AT a location does not appear in THAT location's summary

### ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
1. **DO NOT** make ARA/approach fuel show user input in summaries
2. **DO NOT** disable extra fuel calculations - only disable inputs at non-fuel-adding locations  
3. **DO NOT** assume fuel display logic is the same for all fuel types
4. **DO NOT** change fuel calculation logic without understanding aviation requirements

## üå¶Ô∏è AVIATION WEATHER SYSTEM

## Architecture Overview

FastPlanner is a React/Vite flight planning application with Palantir Foundry OSDK integration. The application follows a **Manager Pattern** with **Context Providers** and **Custom Hooks** for state management.

### Application Flow
```
main.tsx ‚Üí App.jsx ‚Üí FastPlannerPage.jsx ‚Üí FastPlannerApp.jsx ‚Üí FastPlannerCore
```

**FastPlannerApp.jsx** (1,713 lines) is the main orchestration component that:
- Manages top-level state (flightSettings, waypoints, stopCards, routeStats)
- Initializes managers via `useManagers()` hook
- Handles OSDK authentication and data loading
- Provides state to `FastPlannerCore` via props

### Save Flight Flow (ACTUAL)
```
User clicks "Save Flight" ‚Üí SaveFlightCard (RightPanel) ‚Üí RightPanel.handleSaveFlightSubmit ‚Üí Automation (if enabled)
```

**Important**: `SaveFlightButton.jsx` is NOT used in the main application flow. The actual save functionality is:
1. **SaveFlightCard.jsx** - UI form in the right panel
2. **RightPanel.handleSaveFlightSubmit** - Main save logic with automation
3. Weather circles and alternate lines auto-enable logic is in RightPanel.jsx lines 331-419

## Fuel System Architecture - ONE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**PRIMARY FUEL CALCULATION ENGINE:** `StopCardCalculator.js`
- Located: `/src/components/fast-planner/modules/calculations/flight/StopCardCalculator.js`
- **This is the single source of truth for ALL fuel calculations**
- Handles both main route and alternate route fuel calculations
- Integrates weather-based fuel requirements (ARA and approach fuel)

```

**IMPORTANT:** Any references to "MasterFuel" or fuel system migration in documentation are outdated and should be ignored.


### Key Architectural Patterns

**Manager Pattern**: Business logic is encapsulated in manager classes stored in `useRef` for persistence:
- `MapManager`, `WaypointManager`, `PlatformManager` 
- `AircraftManager`, `RouteCalculator`, `FuelCalculationManager`
- Located in `/src/components/fast-planner/modules/`

**Custom Hooks**: Complex state logic extracted into 9 specialized hooks:
- `useManagers()` - Initialize all manager instances
- `useAircraft()` - Aircraft selection and fuel policies
- `useWaypoints()` - Waypoint operations and mode handling
- Located in `/src/components/fast-planner/hooks/`

**Context Providers**: Cross-cutting concerns managed via contexts:
- `AuthContext` - OSDK authentication
- `RegionContext` - Region-based data loading and filtering
- Additional contexts in `/src/components/fast-planner/context/`

### Core UI Structure
```
FastPlannerCore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AppHeader (iPad-friendly header)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MapComponent (Full-width Mapbox GL map)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LeftPanel (Route input, waypoints, controls)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RightPanel (Aircraft, settings, stop cards, weather)
```

## Key Integration Points

**Palantir Foundry OSDK**: 
- Authentication via OAuth in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Client initialization in `client.ts`
- Aircraft/platform data fetching throughout the app
- Custom SDK located at `@flight-app/sdk`

**Mapbox GL Maps**:
- Interactive mapping with custom layers
- Gulf Coast GeoTIFF overlay support
- Manager-based interaction handling

**External Data Sources**:
- Region-based filtering of aircraft and platforms
- Weather data integration for fuel calculations
- Favorite locations management

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **State modifications**: Start in `FastPlannerApp.jsx`, use existing update functions
2. **New features**: Create custom hooks for complex logic, add managers to `/modules/`
3. **UI components**: Follow the card pattern in `/components/panels/cards/`
4. **Map features**: Extend managers and add corresponding hooks

### Working with Managers
Managers are initialized once and persist throughout the app lifecycle. Access them via the `useManagers()` hook:

```javascript
const { mapManager, waypointManager, aircraftManager } = useManagers();
```

### Regional Data Loading
The app uses region-based filtering for performance. When region changes:
1. Event is dispatched via `RegionContext`
2. Managers reload their data for the new region
3. UI components re-render with filtered data

### Code Organization
- **Core logic**: `/src/components/fast-planner/modules/`
- **UI components**: `/src/components/fast-planner/components/`
- **State management**: `/src/components/fast-planner/hooks/` and `/context/`
- **Calculations**: `/modules/calculations/` (flight, fuel, weather)
- **PDF generation**: `/modules/pdf/` (flight reports)

## Precision Code Editing

This codebase uses a precision editing approach:
- Make targeted changes to specific code sections
- Preserve functional adjacent code
- Create backups before editing critical files
- Use incremental refactoring with small, focused changes

## Build Configuration

**Vite Setup**:
- Runs on port 8080 with strict port enforcement
- Base path `/planner/` for subdirectory deployment
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Manual chunks for OSDK and React vendors

**TypeScript**: Configured for React with strict checking. Use `build:skip-ts` for faster builds during development.

## Important Files to Understand

- `FastPlannerApp.jsx` - Main state orchestration
- `useManagers.js` - Manager initialization and lifecycle
- `AuthContext.tsx` - OSDK authentication flow
- `RegionContext.jsx` - Region-based data loading
- Component index files for understanding module exports

## Project History and Context

FastPlanner is a React application connecting to Palantir's OSDK that provides flight planning functionality for managing routes between oil rigs, airports, and platforms. The project has undergone significant refactoring from a monolithic structure to the current modular architecture.
