# Technical Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED COMPONENTS

### PalantirFlightService.js
- `createFlight()` method working with `createFlightWithWaypoints`
- Proper waypoint filtering (navigation waypoints vs landing stops)
- Structured waypoints JSON format
- Flight creation with crew member assignment

### RightPanel.jsx - handleSaveFlightSubmit()
- Fixed waypoint filtering logic
- TOTVU (navigation waypoints) correctly excluded from locations array
- Only landing stops included in locations parameter
- Debug logging for waypoint classification

### SaveFlightCard.jsx
- Complete form for flight details collection
- ETD, crew member assignment
- Automation checkbox ready for connection

## üîß COMPONENTS NEEDING UPDATES

### SaveFlightCard.jsx - Priority 1
**Missing**: "Use only provided waypoints" checkbox
- Add checkbox UI element
- Wire to `useOnlyProvidedWaypoints` parameter
- Pass to PalantirFlightService

### AutomationService.js - Priority 2  
**Issue**: Automation not triggering after flight save
- Verify `runAutomation()` method
- Fix flight ID extraction from save response
- Reconnect to save workflow in RightPanel

### LoadFlightsCard.jsx - Priority 3
**Status**: Exists but needs flight loading functionality
- Add flight list/search UI
- Connect to Palantir flight loading API
- Parse flight data back to Fast Planner format

## üìÅ FILES TO EXAMINE/UPDATE
1. `/src/components/fast-planner/components/panels/cards/SaveFlightCard.jsx`
2. `/src/components/fast-planner/services/AutomationService.js`
3. `/src/components/fast-planner/components/panels/cards/LoadFlightsCard.jsx`
4. `/src/components/fast-planner/services/PalantirFlightService.js` (add load methods)
5. `/src/components/fast-planner/components/panels/RightPanel.jsx` (automation trigger)

## üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION
Start with SaveFlightCard checkbox - easiest win to build momentum
