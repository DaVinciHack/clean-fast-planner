# Waypoint Mode Fix - STANDALONE SOLUTION

This is a standalone solution to fix the waypoint functionality issues in the Fast Planner application. Instead of modifying React code (which has been problematic), this approach injects a script that fixes the waypoint handling directly.

## How to Apply This Fix

1. **Copy the standalone script file**
   The file `waypoint-fix.js` should be placed in the public directory where it can be served by the web server.

2. **Add the script to index.html**
   Open your `index.html` file (usually in the public directory) and add the following code in the `<head>` section:

   ```html
   <!-- WAYPOINT MODE FIX -->
   <script type="text/javascript">
   // Fix waypoint mode functionality by loading a standalone script
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
     const script = document.createElement('script');
     script.src = '/waypoint-fix.js?v=' + Date.now(); // Add cache-busting parameter
     script.type = 'text/javascript';
     document.head.appendChild(script);
     console.log('WAYPOINT FIX: Loaded standalone fix script');
   });
   </script>
   ```

3. **Restart your development server**
   Restart your development server to ensure the changes take effect.

## What This Fix Does

This standalone solution:

1. Provides a clean implementation of waypoint mode toggle functionality
2. Ensures that waypoints added in waypoint mode actually have `isWaypoint: true` and `type: 'WAYPOINT'`
3. Properly handles route dragging in waypoint mode
4. Adds visual feedback when waypoint mode is toggled
5. Works independently of the React code, making it more reliable

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix and restarting your development server:

1. Open the Fast Planner application
2. Click the "Waypoint Mode" button
3. Click on the map to add waypoints
4. Verify that the added waypoints are properly marked as waypoints

You can also use these debugging functions in the browser console:

- `window.debugWaypoints()` - Shows a table of all waypoints with their types
- `window.setWaypointMode(true)` - Manually enables waypoint mode
- `window.setWaypointMode(false)` - Manually disables waypoint mode

## Troubleshooting

If the fix doesn't seem to be working:

1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Verify that the script is being loaded correctly (look for "WAYPOINT FIX" messages in the console)
3. Make sure you've restarted your development server after adding the script

If you continue to have issues, you can try manually running this code in the browser console:

```javascript
window.isWaypointModeActive = true; // Enable waypoint mode
```

And then click on the map to add a waypoint.
