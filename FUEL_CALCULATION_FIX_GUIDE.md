# Fuel Calculation Fix Guide

## Current Status

The syntax error in ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx has been fixed, and the full application functionality should be restored.

In addition, the following components have been enhanced to fix the fuel calculation issues:

1. **FlightCalculations.js**: Enhanced with better logging and consistent calculations
2. **FlightSettings.jsx**: Updated with an "Update Calculations" button

## How to Test the Fuel Calculation Fix

1. Start the application
2. Create a route with multiple waypoints
3. Go to the Settings tab
4. Change values such as:
   - Deck Time (e.g., from 5 to 10 minutes)
   - Reserve Fuel (e.g., from 600 to 800 lbs)
   - Contingency Fuel Percent (e.g., from 10% to 15%)
5. Click the "Update Calculations" button
6. Return to the main tab and verify the top card values have updated

## Understanding the Fix

The fuel calculation issues were fixed by:

1. Ensuring FlightCalculations.js consistently applies all settings
2. Making sure the RouteStatsCard component uses values directly from FlightCalculations
3. Adding a button to force recalculation when settings change

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter issues with fuel calculations:

1. Open the browser console to check for errors or logs
2. Look for messages starting with "Flight calculations:" and "FlightSettings:"
3. Try adding/removing waypoints to trigger a full recalculation

## Original Issue

The original issue was that changes to settings in the Settings tab (especially deck time, reserve fuel, etc.) were not being properly reflected in the calculations shown in the top card.
