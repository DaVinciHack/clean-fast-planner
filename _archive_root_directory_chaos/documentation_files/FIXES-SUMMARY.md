# Fast Planner Application - Fixes and Debugging

## 1. Original Application Fix

Fixed the null reference error in ModularFastPlannerComponent.jsx by adding a null check:

```javascript
// Changed this line:
platformManagerRef.current && platformManagerRef.current.loadPlatformsFromFoundry(client, defaultRegion.osdkRegion)
```

This prevents the error when `platformManagerRef.current` is null, which was causing the application to crash.

## 2. Removed Force Refresh Aircraft Button

Removed the "Force Refresh Aircraft" button in aircraftDropdownFix.js that was not working correctly and may have been causing issues.

## 3. Refactored Version (context=new) Debugging

Added debugging tools and improvements to help diagnose why aircraft and platforms aren't displaying correctly:

### MapContext.jsx
- Fixed references between platformManagerInstance and mapManagerInstance
- Added a fallback/retry mechanism after a delay to handle race conditions
- Ensured proper error handling and state updates

### RightPanel.jsx
- Added debugging to track aircraft data being passed to the component
- Added tracking for dropdown options to see if they're being populated correctly

### FastPlannerCore.jsx
- Added a "Check Status" button that displays the current state of managers and contexts
- Added functionality to force refresh aircraft data if needed

## How to Test and Debug

1. Original Application (http://localhost:8080/):
   - Should work without errors now with the null check added

2. Refactored Version (http://localhost:8080/?context=new):
   - Use the "Check Status" button to see what data is loaded
   - Use console logs to identify where the data flow breaks
   - The debugging information will help pinpoint why aircraft data shows in logs but not in UI

## Next Steps

1. Check the console logs after our changes to see where data might be getting lost
2. Verify connections between contexts are working properly
3. Focus on the specific component that isn't displaying data correctly

The debugging tools added will make it easier to identify the exact problem without having to add large amounts of code.
