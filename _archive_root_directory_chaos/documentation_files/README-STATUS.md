# Fast Planner Status Update

## Current Implementation Status

We've successfully refactored the Fast Planner application using React Context. Here's the current status:

### Working Components

1. **FastPlannerApp** (new implementation using context providers)
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/?context=new`
   - Status: ✅ Working
   - Features:
     - Map loads correctly
     - Regions load and can be changed
     - Aircraft data loads properly
     - Route Statistics Card displays at the top
     - Debug panel shows correct data

2. **FastPlannerWithContexts** (intermediate implementation with context providers)
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/?context=all`
   - Status: ✅ Working
   - Features: Similar to FastPlannerApp but with all contexts exposed as separate components

3. **FastPlannerWithRegionContext** (minimal implementation with only RegionContext)
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/?context=region`
   - Status: ✅ Working
   - Features: Only includes Region context functionality

### Original Implementation

- **ModularFastPlannerComponent** (original monolithic implementation)
   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/?context=original`
   - Status: ⚠️ Has issues with the platformManager
   - Issue: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'loadPlatformsFromFoundry')"

### Default Behavior

To avoid issues with the original implementation, we've updated the default behavior to use the new FastPlannerApp component. This ensures users get a working experience by default.

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Context Architecture**:
   - Created context providers for Region, Aircraft, Route, and Map data
   - Fixed provider hierarchy to ensure proper dependency management
   - Added proper error handling for missing dependencies

2. **MapManager/PlatformManager Integration**:
   - Added safeguards to ensure platformManager has a reference to mapManager
   - Added null checks before accessing methods
   - Added debugging tools to help diagnose reference issues

3. **UI Components**:
   - Added RouteStatsCard to all implementations
   - Fixed import issues to avoid duplicate component declarations
   - Added LoadingStatusDisplay to show the status of different loading processes

4. **Default Route**:
   - Changed the default route to use the new FastPlannerApp implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Remaining Functionality**:
   - Ensure platforms/rigs are loading correctly on all implementations
   - Implement missing functionality for saving aircraft settings
   - Complete any missing event handlers

2. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove debugging panels once everything is stable
   - Remove the URL parameter switching once the new implementation is fully adopted
   - Standardize coding style across all files

3. **Testing**:
   - Test all features thoroughly in each implementation
   - Test edge cases (authentication issues, network errors, etc.)
   - Verify that calculations match between implementations

## Usage Instructions

- For the stable, refactored version: `http://localhost:8080/` (defaults to the new implementation)
- To specifically use the original version: `http://localhost:8080/?context=original`
- For testing and debugging: use the debug panel and loading status display
