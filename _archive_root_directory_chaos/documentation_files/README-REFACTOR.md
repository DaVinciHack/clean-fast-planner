# Fast Planner Refactoring Changes

## Overview of Changes

We've addressed the critical error in the new context-based implementation of the Fast Planner. The error was occurring because:

1. In RegionContext.jsx, the RegionManager was being created without passing in the required MapManager, causing a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getMap')" error when RegionManager.setRegion() tried to use this.mapManager.

2. The context provider hierarchy was incorrect - RegionProvider needed to come after MapProvider to ensure MapManager is available.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Context Dependencies**:
   - Modified RegionContext to accept mapManager as a prop
   - Modified MapContext to also accept mapManager and platformManager as props
   - Changed FastPlannerApp.jsx to create managers at the top level
   - Restructured the provider hierarchy with MapProvider first, then RegionProvider

2. **Fixed Context Provider Order**:
   - Ensured MapProvider wraps RegionProvider so that mapManager is available
   - Updated all consumer components to respect the proper provider hierarchy

3. **Added Debugging Tools**:
   - Created a DebugPanel component to display the status of various managers
   - Added logging for key operations to help diagnose issues

4. **URL-based Component Selection**:
   - Updated App.tsx to render different implementations based on URL parameters
   - Added BrowserRouter to main.tsx to support URL parameters

## How to Test

1. **Using URL Parameters**:
   You can test different implementations by using URL parameters:

   - Default implementation (original monolithic component):
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/
     ```
   
   - Region Context only implementation:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/?context=region
     ```
   
   - All contexts implementation:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/?context=all
     ```
   
   - New refactored implementation:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/?context=new
     ```

2. **Debug Panel**:
   A debug panel is included in the bottom left of the screen that shows:
   - Map Manager status
   - Region Manager status
   - Platform Manager status
   - Current Region details

   You can toggle this panel using the "Hide Debug" / "Show Debug" button in the bottom right.

## Next Steps

1. **Test all contexts thoroughly**:
   - Test that the map loads correctly
   - Test that region selection works
   - Test that aircraft selection works
   - Test that route planning works

2. **Once verified working**:
   - Make FastPlannerApp the default component in App.tsx
   - Remove the URL parameter switching logic
   - Keep the debug panel for ongoing development

3. **Continue with planned refactoring**:
   - Move more functionality from ModularFastPlannerComponent to context providers
   - Break down the UI components further for better maintainability
   - Implement proper error handling throughout the application

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was dependencies between managers:
- RegionManager depends on MapManager
- PlatformManager depends on MapManager

The original monolithic component handled this correctly, but when splitting into contexts, these dependencies weren't properly maintained, resulting in null reference errors.

The solution was to:
1. Create managers at the top component level
2. Pass managers down through context providers
3. Ensure the correct initialization order

This approach maintains the dependencies while allowing us to benefit from the context-based architecture.
