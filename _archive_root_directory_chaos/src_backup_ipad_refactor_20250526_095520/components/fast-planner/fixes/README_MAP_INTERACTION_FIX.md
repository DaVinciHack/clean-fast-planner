# Map Click and Drag Issues Fix

This fix addresses the issues with map clicking, platform selection, and dragging functionality in the Fast Planner application.

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing several issues:
1. Multiple waypoints being added with a single click
2. Inability to click on rigs/airfields properly
3. When dragging the route line, it added points at the bottom instead of inserting them
4. Left panel interaction was conflicting with map clicks

## Fix Implementation

The comprehensive fix (`fix-map-interaction-comprehensive.js`) takes the following approach:

1. **Cleanup of Overlapping Click Handlers**
   - Removes all existing click handlers to avoid duplication
   - Establishes a single source of truth for click handling

2. **Debounce Implementation**
   - Prevents rapid/duplicate clicks from creating multiple waypoints
   - Tracks click state to avoid processing multiple clicks at once

3. **Clean Implementation of Core Methods**
   - Provides clean implementations of key methods:
     - `handleMapClick`
     - `handlePlatformClick`
     - `handleRouteClick`
     - `addWaypoint`

4. **Route Drag Fixes**
   - Properly tracks drag state to prevent click events during drag
   - Ensures route points are inserted at the correct position
   - Handles nearest platform snapping correctly

5. **Global State Management**
   - Uses flags to track important states:
     - `_isAddingWaypoint`
     - `_isRouteDragging`
     - `_routeDragJustFinished`
     - `_lastMapClickTime`
     - `_lastMapClickCoords`

## How to Apply the Fix

The fix is already applied to the current version of FastPlannerApp.jsx. If you need to re-apply it:

1. Run the script:
   ```
   cd /src/components/fast-planner
   ./apply-map-interaction-fix.sh
   ```

2. Alternatively, manually ensure the fix is imported in FastPlannerApp.jsx:
   ```javascript
   // IMPORTANT: Consolidated fix for map click issues
   import './fixes/fix-map-interaction-comprehensive.js';
   ```

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:
1. Single waypoints added when clicking on the map
2. Proper platform/rig selection when clicking on them
3. Route dragging properly inserts waypoints at the correct position
4. Left panel interactions don't interfere with map clicks

A notification should appear briefly with "Map interaction fix applied successfully" when the fix is loaded.

## Debugging

If issues persist, use the Waypoint/Stop Debug button (top right corner) to:
1. Toggle waypoint mode manually
2. Reset map handlers
3. Apply all fixes at once
4. Refresh the page

## Technical Notes

- The fix is designed to work alongside other fixes but takes precedence for map interactions
- It preserves all essential callback functionality while fixing the implementation
- The fix has been tested with both waypoint mode and normal mode
