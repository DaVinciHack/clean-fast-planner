// This is a helper file to indicate that the debug overlay should be removed
// from FastPlannerApp.jsx at around line 2325

// Instructions:
// 1. Find the debug overlay div in FastPlannerApp.jsx (search for "Debug overlay for stop cards")
// 2. Remove the entire debug overlay div (it's a fixed position div that shows stop cards debug info)
// 3. This will clean up the UI for the final implementation
